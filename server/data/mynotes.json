Have that best friend which has an ID but we can also do is we can use something cold. Populated and we're going to say we want to populate the best friend field and when I say we're going to know something interesting now that best friend instead of just being an ID has all of the data for the actual best friend object and that's really cool because in mongodb you can't really do joints very well it's a mongoose has this populate method which essentially allows you to do is say hey and ID's inside of this model and all the other model go and find that object and put all the data for it inside of his best friend section so that we can actually do a joint without really doing a joint it's a really cool picture of mongoose.

      "if you use express you're probably familiar with middle where the Middle where Mongoose allows you to insert coat in between different action for example save any user or creating a user staving validating removing an update one don't really worry about the update one really the only Middle where you care about is going to be safe validate and remove so in order to create some metal work you want to take your schema and you want to say either pre or post so if you want this to go to work to record before the thing that were talking about you use pre so I'm going to do some it over before I save my model I'm going to use priests and then I say say it was either going to be save or something like validate here or it's going to be removed so if you want to like do something before you delete something use your mood or if you want to do it before you validate use validate and I want to do something before we safe cakes in the next property and just like normal Network you call this next functions to move on to the next middle work if you want to do that so here all I want to do it I want to take my updated at",
      "is it to date. Now I just want to update my updated at to the newest time and then call next so what does does is it says every time I go to save the user I want to take this updated field update it and then continue on with the rest of my code go on to the safest level of I left this mess out is not actually going to move on to the next thing in line now by doing this if we were to update this user you're going to see that it's going to update updated Hatfield Forest so right now he updated Outfield hears you know 2021 11:05 and we have 17 0428 now if we want to come in here we say user",
      "I'm sure that we await this we should see that is updated time is in incremented a cremation Wii console dog to use her down here below it now we saved you can see the updated time is 0 4:57 and before we throw a little ways you can see was 0428 so it has been incremented to the newest updated at time we can also do a post for example if I come in to hear I can just copy all this code we're going to do a post safe is going to happen after the save and hear all I want to do is I just want to say this. Say I actually cannot use this because instead of the document has been saved so he say hi Ms. Right here is just the user object that thing that has been safe now it's going to say hi and then move on to the next piece of middleware now if we go into our script I would just say this if I scroll all the way down here you can see it said hi my name is Kyle and I happen to directly after save so it's happening between this user log and the one below it because they allow you to actually make sure things go on so if you don't want to allow save you can just get rid of this next",
      "what does save fails and in order to actually show you how that's going that's just put in here in Terror so we can throw a new error message of Fail-Safe now we click save here I feel safe and that's because here we're catching that are and printed out here if I get rid of this console log user it's easier to see it just has failsafe plan are we can save for evaluate post save and so on and everything you need to know about mongoose also if you want to make sure you take your mongodb game to the next level you're going to want to download my free mongodb cheat sheet link below it's going to help you with mongodb and highly recommended that I said thank you very much for watching and have a good day",
      "a database for your project than mongodb is a great choice but it can be difficult to learn it first so this video I'm going to break down every important Concept in mongodb so you can become an x-ray at the end of the video we're going to cover everything from the basics of create read update delete all the way to more advanced advanced update so make sure you stick around to the end of the video",
      "welcome back to web dev simplified my name is Kyle and my job is to simplify the web for you so you can start building your dream project sooner than this. We're going to be doing a mongodb crash course you're going to need to install mongodb going to have links to these pages in the description below scroll down and find your operating system and then just installed the community edition of mongodb ultra",
      "meatball step and that'll be all you need to do and then once you have mongodb install you're going to need to install Mongo sh this is the show that you can work with to actually access in read database queries so just come down here to your operating system click on it and then follow the steps down below it's pretty straightforward and once you have that done you could open up a terminal but I just have here and you can type in the command Mungo sh that's going to open up that shelf and it says we're using mongodb version 5 we have version one of my uncle s h that's because this version 5 of mongodb and Mongo at HR very new they came out just a few weeks ago so this is going to be the most up-to-date information you can find the first set of commands I want to talk about her just basic commands that allow you to actually use the longo s h terminal and build a crate in a few different databases and first you'll see that we have the word test written here that's essentially the name of the database that were currently using this is just the default database you get started in the test database has no data and it doesn't really exist yet until you create data in order to view your databases you need to type in to show space DDS and d d s just a database",
